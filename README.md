### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Preda. I'm currently studying Informatics and Computing Engineering @FEUP and will be interning at @ESA starting September 2022.

I'm passionate about lower-level technologies such as Embedded Systems, Distributed Networks and Operating Systems.

I enjoy playing volleyball, gaming in general and to spend time with my girlfriend. K-dramas are also great! ðŸ˜„
